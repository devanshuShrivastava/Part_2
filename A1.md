**i) ****PUBG (Player Unknown's Battle Ground)**

This game is multiplayer game is offered to the users by Tencent Games and the development center is in Singapore. The basic idea of this game is to kill and survive till the last player falls down. The last team to survive will get the "Chicken dinner". So when you sign in using your credentials for Facebook; you can socialize with friends while playing PUBG and this is really the USP for this game. On the welcome screen you will come across many gifts and rewards; I was able to open a beautiful skin for my Kar-98. So this game has many teams and each and every team has not more than 4members. When I was playing this game for the first time I was stunned and happy on seeing the outstanding visuals and the features this game provides to its users. This game is easily downloadable on both android and iOS mobile devices. This game has more than a million downloads. People from all around the globe comes to play this commendable game. As this is an open world, teams can land anywhere in the map. Hence, every team tries to reach to the safe zone as soon as possible so that they can grab the gears and ammunition to survive and win the 'chicken dinner'.

The take away for the users of this game is multiple things like: users can communicate while they are in the game with fellow team-mates and this provides a good channel of understanding and coordination with the team-mates, the great graphics are irresistible also the vehicles, and the apparels. This game gives you the first player shooting game feeling that too on your mobile device and this is awesome.

To create this game so worthy developers used technologies like Python and C++, JAVA.  It will also have PHP (or JavaScript) as its web interface. Some of the things I dislike about this game is how the game has only fewer game maps to be played with; hence, there must be new maps and new exciting features like the Rocket Launchers, Land Mines etc. Although, game uses a great amount of CPU but to get this great performance you need a trade-off.

I would have improved the game by introducing more and more real weaponries and vehicles. Also, I would have cut down the prices for the in app purchases on many modes and apparels that way users can be little more than happy.

**ii) ****MSQRD (Masquerade)**

This application is really amazing as with this application one can modify their faces using some great amazing filters and this application is offered by              Facebook. Record video selfie animations, change the way you look and send it to friends via your favorite messengers and social networks. This is what the application does in short for the users who uses this application.

I choose this application because of the filters that are present in this application and which are more and more interesting. Once I tried a face of alien, it was amazing feeling to look myself in the face of an alien. This is what attracts the users of the world to use this application over other applications. This application can record the user putting on some great face filters and then they can send their recordings to social media. That way it's a win-win situation for both the users and the developers of this application (as they are getting profit from the users). Users of this application can also use this application on their friends and make some happy moments.

How this applications works is that it divides the image into interconnected cells. The cells are analyzed in various scales and, based on the direction of the brim and intensity of the color gradient, it is defined whether a certain fragment features a face or not. Then, after the face is identified, the analysis and recognition of its separate elements begin (of eyes, lips, brows, etc.). For that, the operation of the facial landmark detection is conducted. The operation scans the part of an image with a face (the app identifies it as a fragment situated inside the restricting frame created via the previous methods) and indicates the precise coordinates of all the facial elements on the 2D plane.

 The strength of this application is that it is owned by Facebook and also it has great amount of filters. Users can be happy seeing them in other faces and hence this is some great strengths about this application but there are few potential problems with this application. Firstly, UI is not up-to the mark and this makes the application to be used not that often like Snapchat. Secondly, users have observed that the amount of exciting filters are different in both IPhone and Android. Sometimes, users complain that they have like regular faces and hence this application needs many great face filters. I would personally like to add on some cool UI/UX and some great innovative features like video calls using the face masks and the addition of many more face masks. So that way users can be more than happy to use this application.
